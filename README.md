# Advent of Code (2023)

My personal solutions for Advent of Code 2023. Written in [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/) but should be
compatible with [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/)

## Goals
1. Enjoy the last month of the year (2023)
2. Learning lua
3. Joining the hype
4. Improve problem solving as software engineer (alternative for leetcode for a
   while)

## Quick Setup

To be able to run the code, you would need to get the puzzle input from AOC
[website](), and then redirect it to the standard input for the program.

ps: AOC puzzle is actually copyrighted, which is why they shouldn't be included
in this repository!

Using lua (5.4) & luarocks

Running the file (pipe the input into stdin):
```
cat input.txt | ./lua -l set_paths day-<x>.lua <part (ex: 1 or 2)>
```

Example:
```
cat input.txt | ./lua -l set_paths day-1.lua 1 
```

## Achievement

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --: | ------ | ------ |
|  1  |  * | * |
|  2  |  * | * |
|  3  |  * | * |
|  4  |  * | * |
